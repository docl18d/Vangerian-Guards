<h2>**This is a working Web Site to provide immediate information for Tribe Members as it gets built**.  
	<br>I am doing the HTML first to get the info out then I will hit the CSS and make the site look nice.  But as Chieftan, I wanted to get the information out even if it looks raw, and it's been a while since I wrote code</br>

	<h2>Why Verangiann Guards?</h2>	
		<p><h2>The <em>The Varangian Guards</em> were elite bodyguards from the tenth to the fourteenth century to the Byzantine emperors. The Varangian Guard was known for being primarily composed of recruits from northern Europe, including mainly Norsemen from Scandinavia but also Anglo-Saxons from England. The recruitment of distant foreigners from outside Byzantium to serve as the emperor's personal guard was pursued as a deliberate policy, as they lacked local political loyalties and could be counted upon to suppress revolts by disloyal Byzantine factions.</h2></p>
		<p><h2>The Norse Varangian guards were recognized by long hair, a red ruby set in the left ear and ornamented dragons sewn on their chainmail shirts.  The Varangian Guard not only provided security for the Byzantine emperors, but also participated in many wars, often playing a decisive role, since they were usually deployed at critical moments of a battle. As early as 911 C.E.  the Varangian Guards are mentioned as fighting as mercenaries.</h2></p>
		<p><h2>Since Varangian Guards was not available to us for a Guild name, we added an extra 'n' to Veringian and viola....Verengiann Guards Guild.  However, we dont call ourselves a guild....we are a Tribe</h2></p>
