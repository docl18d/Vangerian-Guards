		<h1>**We are a new Guild (we prefer the term <em>Tribe</em>) and it has been a longtime since I wrote code.  This is a working web site to provide immediate relavant information for the Tribe members as the site gets built**.</h1>
		<p><h2>I am doing the HTML first to get the info out then, I will work on the CSS and JS later to make it look pretty and pleasing.  But as the current Chieftan, I wanted to get the information out even if it looks raw.  After all the data is what is important....not how pretty it looks.</h2></p>

		<h2>Why Verangiann Guards?</h2>	
		<p><h2>The <em>The Varangian Guards</em> were elite bodyguards from the tenth to the fourteenth century to the Byzantine emperors. The Varangian Guard was known for being primarily composed of recruits from northern Europe, including mainly Norsemen from Scandinavia but also Anglo-Saxons from England. The recruitment of distant foreigners from outside Byzantium to serve as the emperor's personal guard was pursued as a deliberate policy, as they lacked local political loyalties and could be counted upon to suppress revolts by disloyal Byzantine factions.</h2></p>
		<h2>The Norse Varangian guards were recognized by long hair, a red ruby set in the left ear and ornamented dragons sewn on their chainmail shirts.</h2>
		<p><h2>The Varangian Guard not only provided security for the Byzantine emperors, but also participated in many wars, often playing a decisive role, since they were usually deployed at critical moments of a battle. As early as 911 C.E. the Varangian Guards are mentioned as fighting as mercenaries.</h2></p>
		<h2>Since Varangian Guards name was not available to us for a Guild name, we added an extra 'n' to Veringian and viola....Verengiann Guards Tribe.</h2>
