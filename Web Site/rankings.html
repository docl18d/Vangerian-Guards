	<h1>Since we are a Tribe, we dont use terms like Guild Leader or officers.  We stay true to the old ways and customs!</h1>
	<p><h2>Chieftain: Is in Charge of the Tribe.  He/she provides vision, insight, and goals for the Tribe.  The Chieften focuses on ways to grow the reputation, achievements, and the capabilities of the Tribe.</h2></p>
	<p><h2>Jarl: A chief who develops the rules, standards, and conduct for the Tribe.  Being in the Tribe should be a fun, worry free experience.  Tribe members should never bring dishonor to the Tribe by being rude, insulting, calling names, or creating conflict within and outside of the Tribe.  The Jarls settles all disputes within the Tribe.They invite in and when neccessary hold a Ting to boot Tribesmen that are asshats.  Some Jarls are elected, while others inherit their position. The Jarls will make and post the rules of conduct for the Tribe.</h2></p>
	<p><h2>Hǫfðingi: An Overseer over a specific order within the Tribe.  For example, the Warriors will have a Hǫfðingi, as will the Priests, the Hunters, etc.  The Hǫfðingi is responsible for helping the Einherjar within their order.  They provide mentoring to lower Einherjar on how to master their order.  The viking word félag meant fellowhip or partnership.  The Hǫfðingi are responsible for the fellowshipping within their order.</h2></p>
	<p><h2>Thegn: A mature Einherjar that has extensive experience in Pillaging and Plundering.  They will lead the forays into various raiding lands and dungeons.  They will make sure all Tribe forays are listed on the calander for all Tribespeople to see and sign up for.  They will know everything they can about where they will be leading the Tribe on foraying excursions.</p></h2>
	<p><h2>Dreng: A young Einherjar.They are the focus of development by the Hǫfðingi.  Time should be spent with the Dreng each week to make sure they are progressing in skill Level.  At a minumum each Dregn should try to level up at least 10 levels each week.  Once they hit 70, the focus will change to increasing Item Level and Mythic+ level.  Nothing sucks worse that being in a Tribe that runs mythic+ at the higher level, but leave the Dreng flloundering trying to get to the mythic+ higher levels on their own.  We are a Tribe, we work together.</h2></p>
